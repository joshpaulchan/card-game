# card-game

This is `card-game` project, where I plan to consistenly write and revise clean code/design patterns to make different (card) games.

## In Depth

The goal of this project is to create a game implementation that is generic enough to work with different rules, card types, scoring, etc. This is an exercise in clean code and design patterns, and a place for me to practice factoring and system design.

Besides supporting different games, I'd love to add support for other things, such as:

- [ ] different APIs - socket, CLI (probably over socket), REST, etc.
- [ ] multi player (spectators, players, friends, etc.)
- [ ] non-card-game games
- [ ] different UIs - CLI vs CLA (ncurses, etc.) vs native GUI vs web

## Supported Games

- [ ] Texas Hold Em' Poker
- [ ] 8-deck Blackjack
- [ ] Yu-gi-oh
- [ ] Pacman?

## Implemented Design Patterns

TBD
